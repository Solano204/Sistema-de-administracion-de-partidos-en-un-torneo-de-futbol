/**
 * dtos
*User register (with all atributes addreses,etc) commandWriter
*User login (user,paswword,role) commandWriter and commandResponse
*User with all information with all its information
*User with the role of the referee, other with the role of the administrator, with the role of the user here also i show the (user and role)
*Team to get with all its information (without all palyers AND other with all players(also with all information about the players, name,numberJeysey,) ,
* Team with commandHandler to resgister a new team with all its information and also with all employes(the way most efficient POSSIBLE (in this first i need register the team, after will fillin' the array of employees and the final will register the employes  this is a manner my is there is a better that can convert more faster my code better)
*a dto to insert the information about a match that just played but i need register all stats about this match (Here i need to affect the resultAbout the team, and the playerMatchs, see you can work with this entities or i neeed modify it), within this transaction also i need to affect the entities players and match ( the points, goals (both) to follow the starts in realTime)
*Also a  to get the information about the matchStats the same ways all information the players and match stasts)
* A dto to get  all the categories other to register a new category 
* A dtp tp get all teams that belong to the one category (a with only number about the teams, and only where i see all teams teams information (only the name, goals and points))
* Team to get all players in the team ( number of the players), thus ya try to make this action the most fastest possible with the best practice,
    * To insert a new referee 
* A dto that orginize the teams with the most points ( in this dtop will have a nameTeam, goals( both) and points 
* A dtio that orginize the player with the most poinst ( in this dto will have the nameEmploye,goal(both) and points)
* A dtop to register a new player only with  the name because the debt,matchStast,goals and points will be empty becasue is a new player
* A dto to get the certain with all its informaiton ( name,age,dateBirth,goals(both),points)
*Team with only the attribute or attributes that i wanna change ( the way most efficient to avoid create several methods to change a specific thin') 
*player with only the attribute or attributes that i wanna change ( the way most efficient to avoid create several methods to change a specific thin') 
*Category info (name and ageRange)
*To insert a new paymentRefere with all data necessary
*To get the the information about the paymentReferee
*To insert a debtPlayer with all information possible
* To insert a debTtEAM with all information possible
* to get the debtPlayer with all  information possible 
* to gte the debtTeam with sll iinformation possible


*From those dtos i wanna create the action in the application-folder that will get these dtos and convert them to entities of the domain, these entities of domain will be send them to the repository(that implemet the outports) that accept these entities domain, these i make like this because the project will be splitted in 3 layers, the first will be the applicationclient that send these entities or commandHandlers ( Dtos) to the application domain,after the application domain use tha mapper to pass them to these entities domain using mapper ( inclusive here i wanna a library external to mapped these entities, during these method that will handle all the validation apart of the entities, joini the object and entities and after send them to the entities that will recive these repository( that will mapped to entitiesRepository to hit the database in this potsgrest)  these repository will be implemtin' the putports and make the certain actions to get the goal, BUT NOW ONLY I WANNA YOU MAKE THE APPLICATION ACTION TO UP-LEVEL WITHOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPOSITORY OR CLIENT



Repository all the previous action the first stage will get these commanHandler or entities from the Layer APPLICATION when i recive these entities and after will mapped to entitiesRepository to be able to make the operation in the database, each operation that is a implementation of the outport, will get these eneitites and usin' the repository will insert or query or other actions in the database, and the response entities will be the same entities-domain to response to the APPLICATION-LAYER and this can send it To the CLIENT APPLICATION,IN THIS CASE ONLY I WANNA YOU MAKE THE LAYER-REPOSITORY (The APPLICATION-LAYERS AND CLIENT-LAYER WILL IMPLEMENT AFTER NOW ONLY THE REPOSITORY DATABASE LAYER)

The CLIENT-LAYER will recive the entities like commandWriter or commanQuery and send to them' to he APPLICATION-LAYER, then for each these operation will be RESPOINT that will receive these entities USING BODY EntitiyResponse also the response and request
